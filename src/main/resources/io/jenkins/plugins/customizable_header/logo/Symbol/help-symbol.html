    The name of the symbol to use, e.g. <em>symbol-jenkins</em> will show an alternative Jenkins logo.<br/>
    By default, symbols are searched in the ionicons-api plugin.
    If you want to refer to a symbol from another plugin use <em>symbol-mysymbol plugin-myplugin</em><br/>
    The symbol is displayed with <em>class="icon-xlg"</em><br/>
    See <a href="https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/Symbols/">Design Library</a> for more
    details how to specify symbols and which symbols are available.
