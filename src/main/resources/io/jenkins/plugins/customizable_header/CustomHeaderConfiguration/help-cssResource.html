    If you need full control over the styling of the header you can specify here the url to your own css file.
    The url can be an absolute url or relative to the root of Jenkins.<br/>
    You want to put this in the folder <em>userContent</em> in your <em>JENKINS_HOME</em> directory which is exposed under the url
    <em>userContent</em> and can be accessed also by anonymous users.
